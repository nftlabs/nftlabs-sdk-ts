## BundleDropModuleMetadata.primarySaleRecipientAddress property

The address of the receiver of the initial sale.You can use this field to distribute the initial sale proceeds. All drop contracts are required to set this field, even if the tokens are planned to be free. If you plan to do a free drop, you can set this field to `AddressZero`

This does not effect royalties in any way.

For example, if a token is sold for $100, and there is a 0% fee, then $100 will be distributed to the address set on this property.

If the token is sold for $100, and there is a 10% primary sale fee, then $90 will be distributed to the address set on this property.

All secondary sales will use the `sellerFeeBasisPoints` and royalty recipient address.
