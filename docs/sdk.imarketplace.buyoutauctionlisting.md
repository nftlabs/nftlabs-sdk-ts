## IMarketplace.buyoutAuctionListing() method

The offer must be higher as high as the buyout price in order for this buyout to succeed. If the buyout is too low, the method will throw an error.

Buying out an auction listing will purchase all tokens regardless of the quantity. There is no way to buy a partial amount of the tokens.

Assuming this transaction is successful, the buyer will instantly have access to the tokens and does not need to call `closeAuctionListing`<!-- -->.
