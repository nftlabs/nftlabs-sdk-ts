## IMarketplace.getBidBufferBps() method

Fetch the current bid buffer on the marketplace contract. The bid buffer is represented in basis points.

This is a percentage (e.g. 5%). A new bid is considered to be a winning bid only if its bid amount is at least the bid buffer (e.g. 5%) greater than the previous winning bid. This prevents buyers from making very slightly higher bids to win the auctioned items.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
getBidBufferBps(): Promise<BigNumber>;
```
<b>Returns:</b>

Promise&lt;BigNumber&gt;

- The bid buffer in basis points.
